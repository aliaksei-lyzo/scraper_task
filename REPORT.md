1. Raw estimation - at a glance doesn't seem too difficult. I think 2-3 days will be enough to complete. Risk factors - just a basic familiarity with python and AI solutions frameworks. Huge advantage - AI assistants.

2. Approaching the solution:
I intend to utilize GitHub Copilot agentic capabilities (GPT-4.1) to assist in the development process.
For that i will create:
- a copilot-instructions.md file to provide the agent with the necessary context and instructions.
- a PLANNING.md file to outline the project structure, goals, and constraints.
- a TASK.md file to keep track of tasks and progress.
- a REPORT.md file to document the process and findings during the completion of this project

Then I will ask Copilot to help picking the best libraries and tools for the task, create a list of tasks, and start implementing the solution step by step. I will also ask it to help with writing tests for each component as I go along.

So, here we go.

04.05.2025 00:05 Copilot generated task list and project structure. I will start with the first task - setting up the Python virtual environment and installing the required libraries. He estimated total time of 4h 35min for the project. I think it is a bit optimistic, but let's see how it goes.
