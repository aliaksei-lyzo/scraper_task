# Objective

This project is designed to assess your problem-solving skills and ability to quickly learn and apply new technologies, specifically Generative AI (GenAI). You will develop a solution that extracts news articles from provided URLs, generates summaries and identifies topics using GenAI tools.

---

## Task Description

### News Extraction

- Develop a script to scrape news articles from provided URLs.
- Ensure the extracted content captures the full text and headline of the articles.

### GenAI-driven Summarization and Topic Identification

- Use a GenAI platform or tool (e.g. OpenAI's GPT models, or any other LLM) to analyze the articles.
- Your tasks will include:
  - Generating a summary that captures key points.
  - Identifying the main topics of each article.
- The focus should be on effectively integrating and utilizing GenAI tools rather than building from scratch.

### Semantic Search with GenAI

- Store the extracted news, their GenAI-generated summaries, and topics in a vector database.
- Implement a semantic search feature leveraging GenAI tools to interpret and find relevant articles based on user queries.
- This search should understand the context of the queries and match them effectively with the summaries and topics.
- Search should handle semantically close search terms like synonyms.
